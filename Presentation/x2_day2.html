template: plain
name: stl_boost_extensions
header: ## Extensions Provided by Boost

[Boost Platform]: http://www.boost.org

From the libraries available on the [Boost Platform], probably the following are
the most interesting to augment what is provided in the STL:

* With respect to (additional) containers:

  * [Boost.Bimap	](#boost_bimap)
  * [Boost.MultiIndex	](#boost_multi_index)
  * [Boost.PropertyTree	](#boost_property_tree)

* With respect to (additional) algorithms:

  * [Boost.Algorithm	](#boost_algorithm)

* With respect to implementing Iterators:

  * [Boost.Iterator	](#boost_iterator)

* As an alternative to the STL iterator interface for algorithms:

  * [Boost.Range	](#boost_range)

---
template: plain
name: boost_bimap
header: ### Boost.Bimap

[Boost.Bimap]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/bimap/doc/html/index.html
[Boost Platform]: http://www.boost.org

[Boost.Bimap] semantically._[] combines two maps so that

* efficient Bidirectional Lookup is provided, or
* as a concrete example
  * look-up IP-Numbers for Host-Names, and
  * llok-up Host-Names for IP-Numbers.

<!--
.I[
For more information on bidirectional maps see:
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/bimap/doc/html/index.html
]
-->

.F[:
The technique used to implement that kind of bidirectional lookup has not been
researched for the purpose of that presentation. But it can be assumed – as for
most libraries available on the [Boost Platform] – that is at least as
performant as an equivalent "home-grown" solution based on STL components.

template: plain
name: boost_multi_index
header: ### Boost.MultiIndex

[Boost.MultiIndex]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html
[DSL]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language

[Boost.MultiIndex] is the "in memory" equivalent for data base table, i.e.

* by means of very advanced template programming a versatile parametrized class
  is provided
* extending the principles of a map to multiple columns,
  * each of which may be
    * indexable (or not)
    * unique (or not)
  * …

Note that the complexity of advanced template programming is mostly on the
implementors side.

.N[
From the client's perspective it rather appears as [DSL] that can be used in a
"Cook-Book" style, following and extending the examples from the documentation.

template: plain
name: boost_property_tree
header: ### Boost.PropertyTree

[Boost.PropertyTree]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/property_tree.html
[GoF-Composite]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern

[Boost.PropertyTree] provides a data structure close to the [GoF-Composite]
design pattern.

It allows for

* hierarchical nesting (in principally unlimited depths)
  * of pairs of
    * keys and
    * values,
  * with the latter introducing recursion by
    * supporting property (sub-) tree
    * besides atomic elements.

.N[
Property trees (from Boost) are especially if it is necessary to make the
contained information persistent.

template: plain
name: boost_property_tree
header: #### Property Tree Serialisation Formats

[XML]: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/98/10/guide0.html?page=2#AEN58
[JSON]: http://json.org/
[JavaScript]: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript
[INFO File]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/property_tree/parsers.html#property_tree.parsers.info_parser
[INI-Files]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file

There are several serialisation formats to chose from when a property tree is
stored to a file or read-back:

* [XML]  
  with pre-defined tags (**not** any generic XML structure);

* [JSON]  
  a hierarchical data format (made popular by [JavaScript]) for simple
  data exchange in web applications and elsewhere;

* [INFO File]  
  a hierarchical format (much similar to the former), which was specially
  designed for storing a property tree in a text file;

* [INI-Files]  
  as in early versions of  MS-Windows.._[]

.F[:
When storing to and reading from ini-files there are limitations to the property
tree content, especially ini-files were not designed to hold (and easily edit)
nested data structures.

template: plain
name: boost_algorithm
header: ### Boost.Algorithm

[Boost.Algorithm]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/algorithm/doc/html/index.html

[Boost.Algorithm] extends the
[Algorithm Dimension](04_day2.html#stl_algorithm_extensions) of the STL.

E.g. there are algorithms applicable to containers

* for efficiently sub-sequences
* applying comparisons
* … (and more) …

Since 2011 with each of the released ISO standards._[] parts of this library
were included.

.N[
Therefore [Boost.Algorithm] also provides a way to get (some) C++11/C++14
compatibility even if not provided by the compiler vendor.
]

.F[:
I.e. at the time of writing this, with C++11/14.

template: plain
name: boost_iterator
header: ### Boost.Iterator

[Boost.Iterator]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/iterator/doc/index.html

[Boost.Iterator] is two things:

1. It is a clean-up (beyond a pure re-wording) for the
   [Iterator Categories](04_day2.html/#iterator_categories) as originally
   specified with C++98.

2. It helps to avoid much systematic code when implementing new iterators.

<!--
.I[
For more information on extensions to iterators see:
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/iterator/doc/index.html
-->

---
template: plain
name: boost_range
header: ### Boost.Range

[Boost.Range]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/range/doc/html/index.html
[U*ix Pipeline]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29

[Boost.Range] implements all STL algorithms with a different interface:

* Instead of supplying two iterators to specify a range by the element it starts
  with and the first element beyond its end,

* **a single argument** has to be specified
  * which is a **model of some a range concept**, and
  * can be created in various ways.

Of course, creating a range from two iterators is still possible – but it is not
any more the **only** way, as it is with the classic STL API.

.N[
Even more flexibility is achieved with respect to ranges by utility operations,
e.g. to directly feed the output from one algorithm as input to another one.._[]
]

.F[:
As for this operation also an overload is defined for `operator|`, those who are
accustomed to [U*ix Pipeline]s._[] might be appealed also by the nifty look!
]

---
template: plain
name: stl_concurrency_support
header: ## STL Concurrency Support

[Concurrency Support]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread

Though C++11 introduced substantial [Concurrency Support] in the language and
library 

* the STL **does not provide a direct interface** to distribute work among
  several threads, as a means to improve performance on multi-core CPUs, instead

* the STL specification gives leeway to exploit chances for parallelizing
  independent parts of the work,

as long as it stays within the limits of the specified algorithmic complexity.

.W[
The problem is not that STL algorithms cannot be parallelized – it is rather
that developers might not be aware that it does.
]

---
template: plain
name: parallelizing_transparently
header: ### Parallelizing Transparently

E.g. it is **unspecified** by the ISO standard

* in which order `std::count_if` accesses the sequence to process
* which algorithm is used by `std::sort`

Therefore a conforming implementation could well be split the work over a number
threads, given its complexity is O(N) or O(N×log<sub>2</sub>(N) respectively.

.N[
If not explicitly specified for an algorithm, **no particular order** should be
assumed in which the elements on a container are accessed.
]

As this may not have been the case in the past,._[]

* the problem might occur without warning,
* when old code is compiled with a new library version,
* that implements parallelized algorithms without giving notice.

.F[:
The author confesses guilty for having used at least one example to demonstrate
the use of STL algorithms, that had a stateful functor, hence depending on
linear sequential access of container elements, front to back, but the algorithm
used in the example didn't guarantee this!
]

---
template: plain
name: parallelizing_explicitly
header: ### Parallelization Explicitly

If a given library implementation does not exploit chances for parallelizing,
it may be done explicitly.

Given there are four CPU cores, sorting a large._[] array might be done by

* **first** sorting four independent, equally sized segments in four threads –
  using `std::sort` and a bit of arithmetic with respect to the borders,

* **then** merging the two bottom and the two top segments in two threads –
  using `std::inplace_merge` (and some recycled border calculation from
  the first step), and

* **finally** merging the two sorted sections resulting from the previous step –
  again using `std::inplace_merge` on the whole array.

.W[
Though the above sounds simple – and in fact is not that hard to achieve with
what is already provided by the STL – understand that any added complexity tends
to make a program harder to understand and more difficult to maintain.
]

---
template: plain
name: parallelizing_efficient
header: ### Improving Performance - A Word to the Wise

Before applying a performance improvement, be sure to understand the following:

* If some part of a complex task contributes 20% to its total runtime,._[]
  * a performance improvement of 30% wins 6% total,
  * a performance improvement of 50% wins 10% total, and
  * **no** performance improvement will ever win more than 20%.
* Other if some part of a complex task contributes 90% to its total runtime,
  * then … (you will surely be able to do the math yourself).

.N[
The total effect of performance improvements are often hard to predict.
]

Therefore:

* **Measure before you start** …  

… and be sure to measure correctly and check the results for plausibility!

.F[:
This may or may not be much: if applied to a large application, **most** of
its whole source code may not have that impact. When considering an algorithm
in isolation it may not be much if it is the core of the algorithm, not some
preparation, book-keeping, or handling of exceptional conditions.
]

---
template: plain
name: parallelizing_efficient
header: ### Scaling for Multiple Cores

[Packaged Task]: http://de.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/async

The following is well-known – and can be demonstrated by measurements:

.N[
To increase performance it is contra-productive to split a CPU-bound task to
more threads as there are physical cores.._[]
]

When parallelizing with [Packed Tasks] in many cases

* the decision in many cases is best left to the library (implementation),
* assuming it has platform or operating system specific means to adapt actual
  (hardware) concurrency in the optimal way.

.W[
**Explicitly exempt** from that advice are more or less sophisticated
networks of **tasks that run independently** from each other,
**communicating via buffered pipelines**.
]

**Such designs easily deadlock if the library is allowed to silently turn
asynchronous into synchronous calls.**

.F[:
Or at least to more threads as there independent partial hardware processing
units that can work physically concurrent, like there are in hyper-threading
architectures.

template: plain
name: stl_quirks_and_shortcomings
header: ## STL-Quirks and Shortcomings

[Scott Meyers]: http://www.aristeia.com/

Though the STL has been designed by only two original contributors and
therefore has a quite uniform look&feel, there is some "historic ballast"
that is difficult to get rid of.

The areas considered on the following pages are:

* A few case [Inconsistent naming](#stl_naming_inconsistencies).

* Some non-obvious [Peculiarities of "Big-O"](#stl_big_o_peculiarities)
  complexity specifications.

Both are considered more closely on the next two pages.._[]

.F[:
To give credit where credit is due: this whole section was inspired by some
sequences from the following [Scott Meyers] video, starting at
[minute 37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=5tg1ONG18H8#t=2274):

template: plain

header: ### STL Naming Inconsistencies

[Stable Sort]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability

Purging an element with a given value

* from an `std::list` and an `std:forward_list` is done with the member function
  `remove`, while
* from any associative container it is done with with the member function `erase`.

Sorting elements

* of an `std::list` or an `std::forward_list` needs to be done with the member
  function `sort`
  * which guarantees a [Stable Sort], while
* for any other sequential container it is done with the (non-member) algorithm
  `std::sort`,
  * which **is not guaranteed to be a stable sort**, and
  * as if this is desired `std::stable_sort` has to be used.

(More cases as those discussed above may exist.)

---
template: plain
name: stl_big_o_peculiarities
header: ### STL Non-Obvious "Big-O" Complexity

Usually operations are not implemented if this were only possible with a
substantial performance penalty.

* Therefore `std::vector` has no member function `push_font` as `std::deque` and
  `std::list` have …
  * … but you can still use the `insert` member function anywhere, though
   O(N<sup>2</sup>) performance.

* Nonetheless `std::binary_search` is applicable to linear lists and specified
  to have "good" O(log<sub>2</sub>(N)) performance …
  * … though in this case you would naively expect much worse O(N).

* Adding elements to an `std::vector` at its end is specified to run in
  amortized constant time,
  * even though the available space must be eventually enlarged,
  * an operation more and more expensive, each time it happens.

(More cases as those discussed above may exist.)

Besides the knowledge areas listed in the *Requirements* section of each project,

[Qt's QTestLib]: http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qtestlib-manual.html

template: plain
name: assert_based_testing
header: ####  Assertion Based Testing (1)

Assertion bases testing is based on … `assert`-ions.

The following demonstrates the approach with a test of the faculty function:._[]
```
#include <cassert> // necessary to access the 'assert'-macro
                   // (as a macro, there is no std::-prefix)

unsigned long long faculty(unsigned long long n) {
    return n ? n*faculty(n-1) : 1;
}

int main() {
    assert(faculty(5) == 120); // 1*2*3*4*5 => 120

    assert(faculty(2) == 2);   // 1*2 => 2
    assert(faculty(1) == 1);   // 1 => 1 (border case)
    assert(faculty(0) == 1);   // => 1 (mathematically correct!)
}
```

.F[:
In an attempt to stay with most simple of all thinkable solutions, the scheme as
outlined aboves applies the *"no news is good news"* principle, i.e. if you run
the program and **nothing at all** happens, everything works as expected.
]

---
template: plain
name: assert_based_testing_2
header: ####  Assertion Based Testing (2)

[String Streams]: http://de.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_stringstream

Making a program "trivially interesting" often involves some input and output.
The following applies `assert-based` testing via [String Streams].

First the candidate under test:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

void say_hello(std::istream &in, std::ostream &out) {
    std::string name;
    while (in >> name)
        out << "hello, " << name << '\n';
}
```

Note that the above is not written as `main` program but just as a function.

If course, it could therefore be called that way and tried with manual input and
visually checking the response:
```
int main() {
    say_hello(std::cin, std::cout);
}
```

---
template: plain
name: assert_based_testing_3
header: ####  Assertion Based Testing (3)

Of course, what was originally intended was an automated test, possibly supplying
different input and comparing the output to an expectation:
```
#include <sstream>

int main() {
    {// ---------------------- test with just one name
        std::istringstream iss("world");
        std::ostringstream oss;
        say_hello(iss, oss);
        assert(oss.str() == "hello, world\n");
    }
    {// ---------------------- test border case (empty input)
        std::istringstream iss("world");
        std::ostringstream oss;
        say_hello(iss, oss);
        assert(oss.str() == ""); // <-- expect not even a newline
    }
    std::cout << "*** ALL TESTS PASSED\n"; // not any longer:
                                           // no news is good news
}
```

.F[:
Note the use of inner blocks to ease adding another test with a simple
Copy&Paste.
]

---
template: plain
name: simplistic_home_grown_tdd
header: ####  Simplistic Home-Grown TDD

This approach is a slight extension of the following macro, which turns out to
be extremely versatile in small demo programs:
```
#include <iostream>
#define P(what)\
    std::cout << "[" << __LINE__ << "] " #what " --> "\
              << (what) << std::endl
```

The intended use is to print expressions in a "self-documenting" way:
.pull-left[
```
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    auto s = {3, 5, -4, 1, 12};
    auto r = std::minmax(s);
    P(s.first);
    P(s.last);
}
```
]
.pull-right[
The output produced when both fragments._[] are compiled together and run will
look as follows:._[]
```
[10] r.first ==> -4
[11] r.second ==> 12
```
(Assuming `P` was used in lines 10 and 11 of the source shown left.)
]

.F[:
Of course the macro definition may go into a header is included in every source
using `P`.
]

---
template: plain
name: simplistic_home_grown_tdd_2
header: ####  Simplistic Home-Grown TDD (2)

The obvious advantage over [Assertion Based Testing](#assert_based_testing) is:

* The values are included in the output.

The (also obvious) disadvantage is:

* There is no indication whether the output is what was expected.

The latter can be cured by adding another macro taking the expected value as
second argument and showing a different mark (`!=!` instead of `-->`) when the
actual value differs from the expected …
```
#define XP(what, expected)\
    std::cout << "[" << __LINE__ << "] " #what\
              << ((what) == expected ? " ==> " : " !=! ")\
              << (what) << std::endl
```

… though to print the actual value you only need to change back to the `P`-macro
… and purge the second argument for the moment … or introduce a pro-forma second
argument to `X` too which gets ignored … and of course now any self-proclaimed C
language expert world-wide will happily point out that a macro argument should
**never ever* be used twice … so its time to turn the page once more …

It should be clear that we are quickly approaching the point at which it will
probably pay to give up the home-grown approach and switch to a full-blown
TDD framework.

For the sake of completeness here is another test program …
```
#include <algorithm>
#include <sstream>
#include <iterator>

int main() {
    const int x[] = { 1, 5, 5, 8, 1, 12, 1, 5 };
    std::ostringstream oss;
    // do not copy any duplicates from the above sequence
    std::unique_copy(std::begin(x), std::end(x),
                     std::ostream_iterator<int>(oss, " "));
    XP(oss.str(), "1 5 8 12 ");
}
```

… and the message showing how `std::unique_copy` failed:._[]
```
[21] oss.str() --> 1 5 8 1 12 1 5  !=! 1 5 8 12  <-- (expected)
```

.F[:
Actually it is not so much `std::unique_copy` that failed – it exactly behaves
as specified – but a wrong expectation on the tester's side: not *all*
duplicates are skipped over, only *adjacent* duplicates.
