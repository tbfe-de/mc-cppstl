template: plain
class: agenda

header: ## Agenda

Mandatory topics – covering two days, morning and afternoon – are:

.pull-left[
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**FIRST DAY**

* [Fundamental Architecture				](01_day1.html)
* [STL Containers					](02_day1.html)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
]

.pull-right[
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**SECOND DAY**

* [Iterators and Algorithms				](03_day2.html)
* [Extending the STL					](04_day2.html)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
]

Optional Parts on both days may be be chosen from:._[]

.pull-left[
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [Considering Memory Footprint …
  and Runtime Performance				](x1_day1.html)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
]
.pull-right[
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [Various Odds and Ends 				](x2_day2.html)
* [A Set of Micro-Projects				](microprojects.html)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
]

In the 3-day version of this course all of the above is covered in a relaxed
time frame giving substantially more room for practical exercises and
presentation of selected solutions.

.F[:
In the 2-day version on the second day some selected solutions may rather be
explained as demo-programs and partially replace individual practical
exercises ending the day.

header: ### Online References

C++ has become a huge topic so it will frequently be necessary to lookup
details in an online reference.

As general C++ reference the following can be recommended:

* http://en.cppreference.com/w/ – totally free, seems to be run by enthusiasts
  and now includes even [live examples](#online_compilation)

* http://www.cplusplus.com/ – obviously financed by moderate pop-ups,
  nevertheless well organized and up-to-date

This presentation uses a free HTML5-based slide-show tool named [`remark`](http://remarkjs.com).

#### Viewing

You may use any recent browser of your choice.

* [JavaScript] must be enabled.
* [Modern CSS] should be supported.._[]

header: ### Following Links

Many clickable links have been provided in the hope they will give the online
version an added value over the print-outs you received.

.I[
You may want to follow links when viewing this presentation by **clicking with the
CTRL-key held** down, what will open the target document in a separate browser tab.
]

**Because in some countries the law may require it, here is the necessary
cautionary disclaimer:**

.N.center[
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES NEITHER THE AUTHOR OF THIS
DOCUMENT NOR THE COMPANY OR ANY ONE ELSE WHO MADE IT ACCESSIBLE TO YOU CAN BE

template: plain
header: #### Prepared Printouts

Attendees of a training will receive a printed version of this document.

.I[
You may access a final electronic version including recent changes made during
this training or later via download.
]

Printable PDF files have the same base name as the HTML version with and suffix
changed to `.pdf`. E.g. a PDF of this file (assuming you currently view it in
the browser) is [`00_topics.pdf`](00_topic.pdf). 

#### DIY Printouts

  [Chrome Browser]: https://www.google.de/chrome/browser/desktop/

Also, with Google's [Chrome Browser] you can create a PDF any time:

* Using *Print To File* applies a special style suitable for DIN A4
  print-outs in portrait, with the lower half of each page for your notes.

* Notes contained in the presentation **will currently not be printed**.._[]

.F[:
That option may become available in a future version.

template: plain
name: annotations
header: #### Private Annotations

The core content of this HTML file is written in readable [markdown format].._[]

.F[:
With minor extensions, if you happen to know markdown already.
]

You have the option to handle this document by purely electronic means,
*including private annotations* you may want to add.

1. Save the HTML files of the presentation locally.

2. Add annotations with a text editor of your choice.

When viewing the document in a browser you may chose to view your annotations by
changing to *presenter's mode* with the `p` key.

* **You may try it out right now – back to normal is also with `p`.**

.I[
Future versions of this presentation **may or may not** use the notes section for
their own purposes – but in any case it should be possible to merge your private
annotations with a [diff-tool].
]

  [markdown format]: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown
  [diff-tool]:       http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff

???
The content structure of the HTML file is as follows:
````````````````````````````````````````````````````
        (some lines of HTML leader)
        <textarea>
        …
        … first presentation page …
        …
        ---
        … second presentation page …
        ---
        …
        … (etc.)
        …
        ---
        …
        … last presentation page …
        …
        &lt;/textarea>
        (some lines of HTML trailer)
````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Lines consisting of **exactly three minus signs** (nothing else!) are page
separators.

Annotations are shown in *Presenter's View* only and must be separated from
the slide content with a line consisting of **exactly three question marks**.
```
        …
        ---
        …
        … presentation slide content …
        …
        ???
        …
        … annotations added by you …
        …
        ---
        …
```

BTW: The easiest way to include small code examples, what might be a typical
use case for private annotations, is to just indent them by four spaces –
surrounding code fragments with lines of three or more back-ticks, a markdown
extension known as [Fenced Code Blocks], is the other option.

    #include <iostream>
    int main() {
        std::cout << "hello, world\n";
    }

[Fenced Code Blocks]: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks

As we are at it go: when you have this page loaded in a text editor, with the line
above – **not displayed** when you view this in the browser – and the paragraph
before the code example you have a nice way how to embedded links without making
the text flow unreadable or inconvenient to edit.

<!-- The reference in square brackets needs to be unique only within a single slide
     and the line connecting the reference with the external link may be placed
     anywhere in the page ... and HTML comments are another way to annotate,
     not even visible in the Presenter's View.
-->

LAST HINT: When loaded in a text editor you will find this final page close to the
end (or can locate it easily by searching for LAST HINT); if you start from here
instead from the top it may be be easier to discover the document structure, as at
the beginning there are first a number of layout template pages not visible in the
browser.

[Algorithm Library]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm

[David Musser]: http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~musser/

… seems to be the [Algorithm Library] part of the STL, judging from how often
it stays unused while creativity is put into coding more or less complicated
"little pieces of art" (ironic innuendo not by accident).

If there is some time left until we start – may be because we have to wait for
late-comers – the following lecture by *Sean Parent* may be of interest:

[Minute 04:16]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=IzNtM038JuI#t=256
[Minute 12:30]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=IzNtM038JuI#t=750

If there are at least 10…15 minutes to bridge, a good starting point is at
[Minute 12:30].._[]

.F[:
If there time for that kind of intermezzo right now but you want to see later
on your own how a really complicated code gets simplified by using appropriate
STL-algorithms, you may view from [Minute 04:16]. Or go right to the beginning
and watch the introduction too – the host is [Alexander Stepanov], who designed
the STL 20 years ago together with [David Musser].
